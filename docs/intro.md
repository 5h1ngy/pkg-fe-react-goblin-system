# Goblin System Design Language

Goblin System is a dark-first React design system built from scratch, inspired by the ergonomics of Material UI while delivering bespoke tokens, surfaces, and motion.  
The monorepo bundles the theme engine, layout primitives, and production-ready components that all rely on the same typed contract.

## What makes it different?

- **Dark-first foundations**  
  The default theme leans into cinematic dark surfaces with a configurable secondary accent; change the palette at runtime with a single override.
- **One source of truth**  
  `createGoblinTheme` emits palette, typography, spacing, mixins, transitions, shadows, and breakpoints that every component consumes via `styled-components`.
- **Storybook parity**  
  Every documented pattern links to a live Storybook story so you can inspect real implementations and play with props.
- **TypeScript-first authoring**  
  The public API ships with declaration files, discriminated unions for variants, and strongly typed `sx` helpers.
- **Framework agnostic**  
  No routing, state management, or form baggageâ€”drop the kit into any React or Vite project and start composing.
