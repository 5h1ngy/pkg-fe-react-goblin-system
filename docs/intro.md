# Goblin System Design Language

Goblin System is a boutique React design system that powers the portfolio experience behind this repository.  
It packages a cohesive group of foundations, layout primitives, and production-ready components that all speak the same theme contract.

## What makes it different?

- **Dark-first foundations**  
  The default theme embraces a cinematic dark surface with an ochre secondary accent. Fluorescent secondary swatches are only a click away inside the docs header.
- **One source of truth**  
  `createGoblinTheme` generates palette, typography, spacing, mixins, transitions, shadows, and breakpoints that every component consumes via `styled-components`.
- **Storybook parity**  
  Every documented pattern links to a live Storybook story so you can inspect real implementations and play with props.
- **TypeScript-first authoring**  
  The public API ships with declaration files, discriminated unions for variants, and strongly typed `sx` helpers.
- **Framework agnostic**  
  No routing, state management, or form baggageâ€”drop the kit into any React or Vite project and start composing.
