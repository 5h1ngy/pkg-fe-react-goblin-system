# Get Started

Welcome to the **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system** project! This guide will walk you through the initial steps to set up, run, and explore the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**
- **Git**

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd pkg-fe-react-goblin-system
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   If you are using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or if you prefer Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with one of the following commands:

- Using npm:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- Using Yarn:
  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

This will launch the project on a local development server (typically at `http://localhost:3000`). Open this URL in your browser to see the application in action.

## Testing

To run the test suite and ensure everything is working as expected, use:

- Using npm:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Using Yarn:
  ```bash
  yarn test
  ```

This command will run the unit and integration tests configured for the project.

## Building for Production

For a production-ready build, run:

- Using npm:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- Using Yarn:
  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

The build process will optimize and bundle the project into a `build` directory that can be deployed to your hosting environment.

## Next Steps

- For a comprehensive overview of the projectâ€™s structure, design principles, and key features, refer to the [Overview](./overview.md) document.
- Explore additional documentation sections such as components, hooks, HOCs, and state management for more detailed insights into the project.
