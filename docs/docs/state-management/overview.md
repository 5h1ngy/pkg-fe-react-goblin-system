# State Management Overview

In this document, we provide an overview of the state management strategies used in the **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system** project. Effective state management is essential for maintaining predictable and scalable behavior in complex applications. This overview explains the architecture, core principles, and common patterns adopted throughout the project.

## Introduction

State management is a critical aspect of modern front-end development. It involves the storage, retrieval, and updating of application data in a way that is both predictable and efficient. In **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system**, state management plays a key role in ensuring a seamless user experience and maintaining data integrity across various components.

## Core Principles

Our state management approach is guided by several key principles:

- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data flows in a single direction—from parent components down to children—making the application's behavior easier to understand and debug.
- **Immutability:** The state is treated as immutable, ensuring that updates produce new state objects rather than modifying existing ones. This practice helps prevent unintended side effects.
- **Separation of Concerns:** By decoupling state management from UI components, we maintain a clear distinction between business logic and presentation, resulting in a more modular codebase.
- **Scalability:** The chosen architecture can grow with the application, accommodating increasing complexity without compromising performance or maintainability.

## State Management Techniques

### Redux

Redux is a widely-used state management library that provides a centralized store for application data. Its core concepts include:

- **Actions:** Plain objects that describe changes to the state.
- **Reducers:** Functions that update the state based on dispatched actions.
- **Store:** The single source of truth for the application's state.
- **Middleware:** Tools for handling asynchronous operations and side effects.

Redux is ideal for managing complex state interactions and ensuring a predictable flow of data.

### React Context API

For scenarios that require simpler, lightweight state management, the React Context API is used. It enables the sharing of state across components without the need for prop drilling, making it well-suited for:

- Global theming
- User authentication
- Lightweight global state that doesn't require the full Redux overhead

### Combining Redux and Context

In **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system**, both Redux and the React Context API are employed. Redux handles large-scale state interactions and complex data flows, while the Context API is leveraged for less intensive state-sharing needs. This combination allows us to choose the best tool for each specific situation.

## Folder Structure

The state management code is organized within the `src/state-management` directory. This may include:

- **actions:** Definitions of actions that trigger state changes.
- **reducers:** Functions that specify how state updates occur.
- **store:** Configuration and creation of the Redux store.
- **context:** Custom contexts that manage specific slices of state or complement Redux.

## Benefits of Our Approach

- **Predictability:** A clear and consistent flow of data simplifies debugging and enhances overall maintainability.
- **Reusability:** Modular state management logic that can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Performance:** Efficient state updates and re-renders, achieved through immutability and optimized data handling.
- **Ease of Collaboration:** A standardized state management strategy that promotes code consistency and facilitates teamwork.

## Conclusion

The state management strategy in **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system** is designed to support scalable, maintainable, and predictable application behavior. By leveraging both Redux and the React Context API, the project effectively addresses a wide range of state management needs. This overview serves as a foundation for understanding the broader state management practices employed throughout the project.
