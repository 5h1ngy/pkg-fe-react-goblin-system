# Components Overview

This document provides an overview of the components in the **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system** project. Our aim is to explain the design principles, structure, and usage patterns that make up our component library, ensuring a consistent and maintainable user interface.

## Introduction

The **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system** is built using a component-based architecture that leverages the power of React. Each component is designed to be modular, reusable, and easy to integrate, promoting both development efficiency and a cohesive user experience.

## Component Structure

Components are organized within the `src/components` directory. They are typically grouped into the following categories:

- **Presentational Components:** Focus on rendering UI elements based solely on the props they receive. They are stateless and primarily concerned with appearance.
- **Container Components:** Also known as smart components, these handle data fetching, state management, and business logic, passing data down to presentational components.
- **Shared Components:** Commonly used UI elements such as buttons, inputs, modals, and other widgets that are utilized across various parts of the application.

## Design Principles

- **Reusability:** Components are crafted to be reusable across different modules, reducing code duplication and promoting a unified look and feel.
- **Encapsulation:** Each component encapsulates its own logic and styling, minimizing side effects and inter-component dependencies.
- **Separation of Concerns:** By differentiating between presentational and container components, the project maintains a clear separation between UI rendering and business logic.

## Styling and Theming

- **Scoped Styling:** We use CSS Modules or Sass to ensure that styles are scoped to individual components, preventing conflicts and promoting consistency.
- **Theming:** The system supports theming, allowing developers to adjust the visual style of components through a centralized theme configuration.

## Component API and Documentation

Every component includes well-defined APIs through props. Detailed documentation and inline comments provide clear guidance on usage, expected inputs, and behaviors. For specific details on individual components, refer to the corresponding documentation files within this directory.

## Best Practices

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Adhere to established naming conventions for files and components to ensure clarity.
- **Testing:** Each component should have accompanying unit tests to verify functionality and prevent regressions.
- **Clear Prop Definitions:** Use PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces to define component props, ensuring type safety and proper usage.

## Examples

For practical examples of how to use these components within your application, please refer to the [Examples](./examples.md) document. It contains code snippets and integration tips to help you quickly get started.

## Conclusion

This overview outlines the foundational structure and principles behind the component library in **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system**. By following these guidelines, developers can build robust, scalable, and maintainable user interfaces.

Happy coding!
