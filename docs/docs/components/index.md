## Best Practices

For an optimal experience with Goblin System, we recommend following these best practices:

1. **Always use ThemeProvider**: Ensure that all components are wrapped by the `ThemeProvider` to guarantee proper styling.

2. **Leverage layout components**: Use `Container`, `Grid`, and `Spacer` to create consistent and responsive layouts.

3. **Maintain consistency**: Use consistent variants and sizes throughout the application for a better user experience.

4. **Prefer components over custom styles**: Goblin System offers extensive customization options. Try to extend existing components rather than creating styles from scratch.

5. **Properly manage props**: Always pass all necessary props and keep components controlled when appropriate.

6. **Accessibility**: Make sure to provide appropriate labels and ARIA attributes when needed.
