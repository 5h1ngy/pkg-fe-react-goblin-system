# Hooks Overview

This document provides an overview of the hooks used within the **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system** project. It explains the purpose and benefits of both built-in React hooks and the custom hooks that have been developed to streamline business logic and state management.

## Introduction

React hooks enable functional components to manage state, handle side effects, and encapsulate logic without relying on class components. In **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system**, hooks are central to creating clean, maintainable, and reusable code.

## Built-in Hooks

The project leverages several built-in hooks provided by React, including:

- **useState:** Manages local state within functional components.
- **useEffect:** Handles side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM updates.
- **useContext:** Provides access to context values, facilitating global state sharing across components.
- **useMemo & useCallback:** Optimize performance by memoizing values and functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Custom Hooks

Beyond the built-in hooks, custom hooks are used to encapsulate common patterns and business logic. These hooks help in:

- **Code Reusability:** Consolidating repetitive logic into a single, shareable function.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Isolating complex business logic from component rendering, keeping components focused on UI concerns.
- **Enhanced Testability:** Allowing independent testing of logic encapsulated within hooks without coupling it to the UI.

### Examples of Custom Hooks

- **useFetch:** Handles API calls, managing loading, error, and data states seamlessly.
- **useLocalStorage:** Provides a reactive interface to localStorage, enabling state persistence across sessions.
- **useTheme:** Manages theme switching and persists user preferences for a consistent UI experience.

## Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility:** Each hook should serve a specific purpose. Avoid combining multiple unrelated concerns in one hook.
- **Naming Conventions:** Always prefix custom hooks with `use` to follow React's hook naming rules.
- **Isolate Side Effects:** Utilize `useEffect` for side effects to ensure predictable behavior and clean-up.
- **Test Independently:** Write tests for custom hooks to validate their logic in isolation from UI components.

## Conclusion

Hooks form the backbone of the **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system** architecture, enabling developers to build modular, efficient, and easy-to-maintain applications. By leveraging both built-in and custom hooks, the project maintains a clear separation between business logic and presentation, resulting in a more scalable and robust codebase.

Happy coding!
