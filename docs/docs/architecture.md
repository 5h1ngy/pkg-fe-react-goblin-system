# Architecture Overview

The **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system** project is built on a modular and scalable architecture designed to promote maintainability, reusability, and collaborative development. This document outlines the core architectural principles, the organization of the project, and the key design patterns that guide its implementation.

## Core Principles

- **Modularity:** The project is divided into well-defined modules, each addressing a specific area of functionality.
- **Separation of Concerns:** UI components, business logic, state management, and data fetching are kept distinct to simplify maintenance and testing.
- **Reusability:** Components, custom hooks, and utilities are crafted for reuse across the application.
- **Scalability:** The architecture supports the seamless addition of new features without significant restructuring.

## Folder Structure

The `src` directory is organized into several main macrocategories:

- **components:** Contains reusable UI components that form the building blocks of the interface.
- **hooks:** Houses custom hooks that encapsulate shared logic and side effects.
- **hocs:** Provides higher-order components (HOCs) to enhance or modify component behavior.
- **state-management:** Includes tools and configurations for managing the global application state (e.g., Redux or React Context).
- **services:** Manages API communications, data processing, and other backend interactions.
- **utils:** Contains utility functions and helper modules that support various parts of the application.

This structured approach facilitates quick navigation and efficient code management.

## Design Patterns

The project leverages several established design patterns:

- **Component-Based Design:** The UI is built from isolated, reusable components that encapsulate their own logic and styles.
- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs):** These components abstract common functionalities, allowing for enhanced code reuse and separation of concerns.
- **Custom Hooks:** By encapsulating logic and side effects into custom hooks, the project achieves greater modularity and testability.
- **State Management Patterns:** A clear and predictable data flow is maintained through patterns provided by Redux or the Context API.

## Data Flow and Communication

- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data is passed from parent components to children through props, ensuring a predictable state flow.
- **Event Handling:** User interactions are managed via event handlers and callbacks, triggering state updates and re-rendering as needed.
- **API Integration:** Services handle API calls, process responses, and update application state, maintaining a clear separation between data fetching and UI rendering.

## Development Practices

- **Testing:** The architecture supports robust testing strategies, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Continuous Integration:** Automated builds and tests are integrated into the workflow, promoting high-quality code standards.
- **Documentation and Code Reviews:** Comprehensive documentation and regular code reviews ensure that the architecture evolves with best practices in mind.

## Conclusion

The architecture of **pkg-fe-react-goblin-system** is designed to accommodate future growth while maintaining clarity and efficiency. By adhering to established design patterns and best practices, the project ensures that development remains manageable and scalable.
